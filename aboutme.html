<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2 align = "center"> Introduction</h3>

<p align = "center">
    I am an enthusiastic Software Development undergraduate with a diverse set of skills. I have expertise in multiple languages such as C#, C++, Java and JavaScript and in frameworks such as Node.js, Angular and Xamarin. I also have a background in automated testing and development in team-based environments. I am capable of quickly learning and adapting to situations as they arise and enjoy working towards a difficult or challenging task. With my recent workplace I also have experience in Typescript and writing manual and BDD tests. I also have furthered my knowledge of JavaScript. My Final Year Project consisted of creating an app for a disabled client which would allow them to use text to speech through a telephone line, instead of being output through a loudspeaker, all in real time. I worked with Xamarin to achieve this. I achieved a 2:2 in my degree.
